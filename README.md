## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, you can call me John!

_(Sorry for any mistakes. English isn't my first language)_

I was really, really interested in programming way back in my highschool days. I wished to become a game developer, or just at least a general software developer.

Started out by training my mindset with writing a bunch of Batch scripts and watching tutorials. After some time, I discovered and played around with Unity, and made a little game following a bunch of tutorials. A lot of the code is taken from the tutorials of course, but at least I understood how it works and innovated on my own.

Later on, during my highschool years, I got into a bunch of stuff to further train myself and pursuing my dream. To mention, they were:

- Writing Python
- Designing and visual coding games with [**Kodu Game Lab**](https://www.kodugamelab.com/)
- Designing and visual coding Android apps with [**Kodular**](https://www.kodular.io/)
- Writing a bit of C++ code for Arduino projects (forgot how to write C++ now though)
- Designing and visual coding for **LEGOÂ® MINDSTORMSÂ® EV3** and **LEGOÂ® Education SPIKEâ„¢**.
  - Used to participate in the early rounds of a **FIRSTÂ® LEGOÂ® League** competition. Couldn't continue further because it was starting to affect my studying (I was really invested in it)

After highschool, entered university, and of course I chose IT as my major. Up until now, I've had experience with:

- Writing Java. I've had previous experience with C# back then, so I got into it fast enough (though I rarely use Java again after the course, so I forgot most of it)
- Writing HTML, JavaScript and CSS for web development projects. Also became my free time hobby for a period of time
- A bit of React (with JSX) for web development for a course, though I hate it greatly, **with a passion!** >:(
- Writing a bunch of academic reports... (God I hate it so much... I would rather suffer with React)
- _**... and more to come!**_

Right now, I'm working part-time as a software developer for a company that make Roblox game, so I'm also dealing with Lua/Luau, and everything that comes with making a game

Therefore, I would safely say that my dream had fortunately come true, and that years of dreaming and investing myself into learning the beautiful art of programming wasn't a waste! :D
